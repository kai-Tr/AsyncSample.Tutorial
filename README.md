# Advanced Asynchronous Programming in C#
This repository explores advanced concepts in asynchronous programming in C#, focusing on practical implementations and patterns that enhance application performance and maintainability. Here, you'll find detailed examples and in-depth discussions on managing execution contexts and maintaining state across asynchronous calls using ExecutionContext and AsyncLocal.

## Key Features
* ExecutionContext Management: Demonstrates how to manually capture and flow the execution context across threads to ensure that environmental data such as security information, culture settings, and call context data is preserved accurately across asynchronous operations.

* AsyncLocal Usage: Provides examples of using AsyncLocal<T> for storing and flowing data automatically with the execution context across asynchronous calls and thread switches, ideal for scenarios that require thread-specific data isolation.

* Combined Use Cases: Showcases how ExecutionContext and AsyncLocal<T> can be combined to handle complex scenarios like tracking user sessions, managing security tokens, or providing operation-specific logging that persists across asynchronous operations and thread boundaries.

* Practical Examples: Includes practical examples such as tracking operation IDs in a web application to maintain a consistent context for logging and diagnostics across asynchronous method calls and nested tasks.
